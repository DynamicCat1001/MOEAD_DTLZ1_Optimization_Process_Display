# **Overview**
This project demonstrates the optimization process of the multi-objective evolution algorithm on the test function DTLZ1.

# **Built with**
> * [glut library](https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/glut_downloads.php) -construct the display object
> * [eigen library](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) - matrix operation among objective value during optimization

# **key feature**
> * Display interface constructed by glut library.
>> * The optimization process among iterations divided by every 20 iterations is displayed on the left window.
>> * The distribution and IGD value of the final elite solution group of max iteration is displayed on the right window.
> * The optimization of MOEAD on test function DTLZ1.
# **Step**
> 1. input max iteration within the range of 10~1000.

> 2. After the optimization, the Interface shows the results.
> 3. Drag the interface to see the distribution in the objective space.
