# **Overview**
This project is used to demonstrate the optimization process of mulit-objective evolution algorithm on the test function DTLZ1.

# **requirement**
> *The glut and eigen library are used to support the User Interface and the >> matrix evaluation respectively. 
> *These two libraries might be installed and linked well before operating this project.
# **flow**
**Input iteration value**
> *Input maximum iteration of optimization between range 10~1000.
**Read reference points**
>> Read best solution data for IGD indicator calculation.
**Optimizing**
>> Execute MOEAD on test function DTLZ1. 
>> The result of every iterations are stored.
>> Calculate IGD
**Display the results**
>> Rendering with the stored solution Group of different iteration
>> Show the final solution and IGD indicator.
